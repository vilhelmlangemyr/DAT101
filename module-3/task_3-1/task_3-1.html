    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>when the wakeup is 7 the program responds but when it is not 7 the program dont run unless you but a else in there</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>when it was exactly 7 it ran the if (printOut("I can take the bus to school.");) and when it was 6 or 8 it ran "else"  </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>it will go for "else" and print out: printOut("i can take a car to school");. this is because i use === and not f.eks <= or >=  </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>if the number is exactly 0 it will go to "else" and print out "The number is zero". zero is neither positive or negative</p>
