      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				you should use constants when you have a value that will not change throughout the program.
        Variables should be used when the value can change, such as a user's age or a score in a game. Not all values can be constants, as some values need to be updated
        or changed during the execution of the program.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parentheses change the order of operations, forcing the calculations inside them to be done first,
         which can change the result of an expression.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				by using the toFixed() method, which formats a number using fixed-point notation.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				With floating-point numbers, direct comparison can be unreliable due to rounding errors. Instead, we check if the difference between the numbers is very small.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators in JavaScript always return a Boolean value â€” either true or false.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				random() generates a floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). It can be used for randomizing values, such as in games or simulations.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				a modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. It is useful for determining if a number is even or odd, or for wrapping around values within a certain range.
