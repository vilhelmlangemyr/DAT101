 <!-- 
Part 1: Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
Part 2: you have let, const, and var to declare variables in JavaScript.
Part 3: let mittnavn = "Vilhelm Langemyr";
          let alder = 23;
          const fÃ¸dselsÃ¥r = 2001;  
Part 4: if you use let the error goes away.            
Part 5: if you change the numbers (x and y) the result (z) will also change. by using document.write you can write the result directly to the html page.      

Discussion questions:
1. No. if you create a variable without let, const, or var it will become a global variable.
2. you can do it in three ways that i have learned:

way 1:
<script>
  let x = 5;
  let y = 17;
  let z = x + y;

way 2: 
let x, y = 2, z = y;

way 3:
let x; let y = 2; let z = y;

3. variables declared with const cannot be reassigned. if you try to reassign a const variable you will get an error.
4. Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
5. implicit declaration declares a variable without let, const, or var. explicit declaration declares a variable with let, const, or var.
and explicit declaration declares the variable with let, const, or var.
